# knot_stls
produces (hopefully) elegant stl files of mathematical knots from basic line segment descriptions (Arc Presentations), also somewhat fragile support for generation from sketches (in the knot_sketches folder).

The knot paths are meant to converge to a minimum-energy/shortest-path state by shrinking in like elastic (this is by no means garuanteed to be shortest). Less tangled / more organised knots can be obtained by reducing the number of iterations.
